# AI Business Analyst Agent for SMEs

🚀 Built for **Microsoft AI Dev Days Hackathon 2026**

---

## Overview

Small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) generate large amounts of data in Excel and CSV files, but often lack the expertise or time to convert this data into actionable insights. Traditional dashboards show metrics, but rarely answer the critical question: **“What should I do next?”**

This project introduces an **AI Business Analyst Agent** that autonomously analyzes structured business data and produces executive-level insights, risks, opportunities, and recommended actions in clear, non-technical language.

The solution acts as a **virtual business analyst**, helping decision-makers take informed actions without complex BI tools or expensive consulting.

---

## Core Idea

At the heart of the solution is a **single autonomous AI agent**:

### **BusinessAnalystAgent**
- Interprets summarized business data
- Identifies trends, risks, and opportunities
- Generates actionable recommendations
- Communicates in plain business language

The agent is orchestrated using **Microsoft Agent Framework** and leverages **Azure OpenAI** as its reasoning engine.
