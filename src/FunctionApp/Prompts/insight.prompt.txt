Do NOT invent numbers.
Do NOT assume trends not supported by the data.
Do NOT speculate beyond the provided signals.
If a field is not provided, do not reference it.
Do not introduce arbitrary threshold values unless mathematically derived from provided signals.
Every recommendation must reference at least one numeric percentage or count.

Your output MUST be valid JSON and MUST follow this exact schema:

{
  "ExecutiveSummary": "string",
  "KeyRisks": ["string"],
  "Opportunities": ["string"],
  "Recommendations": ["string"]
}

Return JSON only. No explanations. No markdown. No additional text.

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Executive Summary
- Summarize overall performance using provided numeric totals and averages.
- Explicitly mention the record count.
- Reference key category highlights where relevant.
- If AnomalyCount > 0, mention that anomalies were detected.
- If AnomalyCount = 0, explicitly state that anomaly detection was executed and none were found.

2. Key Risks
- Only identify risks supported by:
  - Small dataset size (RecordCount < 30)
  - High category concentration
  - Detected anomalies (if any)
  - Significant imbalance in numeric or categorical distribution
- If AnomalyCount > 0, reference them explicitly.
- Do NOT list absence of anomalies as a risk.
- Do NOT include generic or speculative risks.

3. Opportunities
- Identify opportunities grounded in:
  - Leading numeric totals
  - Strong averages
  - Underrepresented categories
  - Balanced vs concentrated distributions
- Each opportunity must be traceable to a provided summary field.

4. Recommendations
- Provide clear, actionable recommendations.
- Each recommendation must logically follow from the provided summary.
- Avoid vague or unsupported advice.

5. Concentration Rule
- Consider a category “highly concentrated” only if its percentage exceeds 30%.
- Use provided Percentage values for judgment.
- Do not classify concentration without percentage support.

STRICT CONSTRAINTS
---------------------------------------------------------

- Use ONLY the provided summary fields.
- Do NOT hallucinate missing context.
- Do NOT introduce data not explicitly included.
